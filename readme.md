# Flood Analysis Using SAR and Machine Learning

Flooding is one of the most frequent and costly types of natural disasters. Flood mapping is traditionally performed using logical aerial observation or ground surveys.
however, when flooding is widespread, these methods become prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, aerial observation can be challenging or impossible due to obstructive weather conditions.

The Damage a flood can cause heavily depends on the area it is occurring in and not solely on the question whether the water is a few centimeters higher than usual or covers entire houses. Besides their spatial coverage and the depths of water we are looking at, the duration over which floods cover land surfaces can also differ significantly. While some floods may only last days, others may last years, such as the flood in Vicksburg/Missippi, which technically lasted more than 90 years.

Floods occur locally and while their origin can often be attributed to natural causes, the frequency of floods has increased globally and is projected to further increase in the future. Thus, rising water, for whatever reason, is a global phenomenon. Geographically, many land surfaces on our planet can be subject to potential flooding. The only preconditions that need to be fulfilled for flood are either rain and/or the presence of very large water bodies.

Globbaly, drownings due to floods are the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death. it is estimated that approximately 236,000 people (2019) die due to drowning each year. Most of these deaths are accounted for by low- and middle-income countries, where people forced to live in high risk areas or heavy rainfalls have drastically increased in recent decades. Most of these fatalities occur in the WHO Western Pacific and the WHO South-East Asia Region.
