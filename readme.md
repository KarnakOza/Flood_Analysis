# Flood Analysis Using SAR and Machine Learning

Flooding is one of the most frequent and costly types of natural disasters. Flood mapping is traditionally performed using logical aerial observation or ground surveys.
however, when flooding is widespread, these methods become prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, aerial observation can be challenging or impossible due to obstructive weather conditions.
