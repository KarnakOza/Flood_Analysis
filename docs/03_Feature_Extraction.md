# Scattering Mechanism over Water

- Water surfaces represent a special case, since the differences in backscatter are not primarily produced by varying materials or vegetation cover.

  *** Bragg scattering ***
- One scattering mechanisms that is very unique to ocean surfaces is Bragg Scattering. it is resonance effect between the wavelength of the radar microwaves and the small scale waves on the ocean surface.
- The short Bragg-scale waves are formed in response to wind stress. if the sea surface is rippled by a light breeze with no long waves present, the radar backscatter is caused by the component of the wave spectrum which resonates with radar wavelength.
