# Scattering Mechanism over Water

- Water surfaces represent a special case, since the differences in backscatter are not primarily produced by varying materials or vegetation cover.

***Bragg Scattering***
- One scattering mechanisms that is very unique to ocean surfaces is Bragg Scattering. it is resonance effect between the wavelength of the radar microwaves and the small scale waves on the ocean surface.
- The short Bragg-scale waves are formed in response to wind stress. if the sea surface is rippled by a light breeze with no long waves present, the radar backscatter is caused by the component of the wave spectrum which resonates with radar wavelength.
The thresold windscreen value for e.g. the C-band waves is estimated to be at about 3.25 m/s at 10 meters above the surface. The Bragg resonant wave has its crest nominally at right angles to the range direction.
The SAR directly images the spatial distribution of the Bragg-scale waves. The Spatial distribution may be effected by longer gravity waves, through tilt modulation, hydrodynamic modulation and veolocity bunching.

***Doppler Shift***
the perceived change in frequency, which occurs as the distance between the source and the observer of the signal changes. Vver here the frequency change due to the change in distance between the radar antenna and the target on the ground.


***Tilt Modulation***

Tha radar backscatter over ocean surfaces varies in relation to the local incidence angle. This angle is modulated significantly by the tilt of the surface, produced by ocean waves, such as gravity and sweel waves. Even without backscatter effects caused by small scale changes due to wind, this can lead to recognizable pattern in radar images.
