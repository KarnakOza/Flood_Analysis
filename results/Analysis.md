## Preliminary Analysis

- Observations from SAR-Based Flood Mapping.
- Preliminary observations indicate a clear contrast between flooded and non-flooded areas, with backscatter values significantly decreasing over water surfaces due to the smooth reflection of radar signals.
- VV Polarization Observations
- Lower backscatter values over flooded regions, making water bodies appear darker.
- More effective in detecting open water areas compared to vegetated regions.

As seen the drop of backscatter intensity from pre to post.
