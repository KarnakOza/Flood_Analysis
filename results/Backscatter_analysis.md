## Characterization 

- Water smoothness flip the polarity NDPI tracks, water<0.3 confirms water-dominated areas.
- Low NDPI means water

**Below is the Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 SAR: (σθ) VV/VH Backscatter Analysis**

-Phase differences is highly sensitive to dielectic changes flooded soil or leaf surfaces amplify this shift.

-The flood mapping study in Tripura, India, conducted in 2024, utilized dual-polarimetric Sentinel-1 SAR data (VV and VH) to assess
flood-induced scattering changes across multiple dates.

-Backscatter analysis revealed significant post-flood suppression.
